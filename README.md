********************************

This is a project that I developped while in my first module at Ironhack. We we asked to build a game from scratch and I deciced to  build a memory game with a geography theme. Because I loved playing this game when I was a kid, and because I love geography.

This is still work in progress. The idea is to add lots of cool levels with different areas of the world being targeted. And add bonus questions between the levels to test your geography knowledge and earn extra points.

Hope you'll enjoy it !
